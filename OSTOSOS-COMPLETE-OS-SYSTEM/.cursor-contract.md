# Cursor Implementation Contract

- All code changes MUST be applied via ./scripts and committed with audit logs.
- No editor-only changes. All writes produce hashes (pre/post) and are logged.
- Two inspections (TÃœV-I and TÃœV-II) MUST pass before any build.
- Build outputs MUST follow naming schema and folder structure described in ./NAMING.md.
- CI MUST enforce gates: unit, integration, e2e, perf, accessibility, security, compliance.
